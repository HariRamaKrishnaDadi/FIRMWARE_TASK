Testing and Validation

To test this firmware:

--> First we will Set up the serial connection between the MCU and PC.
--> we can Use the send_data function in PC code to send the data to the MCU.
--> In this way we can ensure that each byte is received and stored correctly in EEPROM.
--> MCU will send back the data from EEPROM, and the PC will display the data.





If ATmega328P does not have a built-in millis() function, then we can make use of below function

uint32_t millis() {
    return (TCNT1 * (1024.0 / (F_CPU / 1000)));  
}
and include this line 
TCCR1B |= (1 << CS12) | (1 << CS10);
in main function 


Hopefully this works! if i had hardware then i would have tested myself and took a video recording of it to submit for sure 
and i hope this code reflects my coding skills!
